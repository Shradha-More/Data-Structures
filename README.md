# 📂 Data Structures Implementation

## Overview:

This repository contains implementations of commonly used Data Structures, designed to strengthen problem-solving skills and provide a clear understanding of how data is organized, stored, and manipulated in memory.

The project is intended for students and beginners who want hands-on practice with core data structure concepts.

## Data Structures Covered:

1. Arrays

2. Linked List (Singly / Doubly)

3. Stack

4. Queue

5. Deque

6. Trees (Binary Tree, BST)

7. Graphs (Basic Representation)

8. Hashing

9. Searching Algorithms

10. Sorting Algorithms

## Operations Implemented:

1. Insertion

2. Deletion

3. Traversal

4. Searching

5. Updating

6. Sorting

## Technologies Used:

Programming Language: C++ / Python

## Objectives:

1. To understand core data structure concepts

2. To implement data structures from scratch

3. To analyze time and space complexity

4. To improve algorithmic thinking
